[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/agrodem/badge/?version=latest)](https://agrodem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Documentation available [here](https://agrodem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (under development)

The **agrodem** model provides an estimate of water and electricity requirements for ground and/or surface water irrigation. It works for one crop at a time. Statial distribution of this crop over the area of interest (AoI) can represent current or projected values. Supporting scripts for downscaling/resampling tabular crop data is also available in this repo. 

## Content

- **Downscaling** directory contains scripts, Qgis plugin and sample files needed to prepare input files to the FLAT model
- **FLAT_model** directory contains scripts supporting the FLAT model
- **Irrigation_model** directory contains scripts, Qgis plugin and sample files needed to prepare input files to the agrodem model
- **agrodem.ipynb** the model
- **pyeto** directory contains contains modules needed to properly run the agrodem.ipynb
- **Sample_results** directory contains indicating results (and html map) of the agrodem model
- **docs** directory contains supporting documentation for running the analysis
- Sample_Moz_Maize_1km.csv 
- Sample_Maize_Crop_Calendar.xlsx

The sample files can be used to estimate maize irrigation needs in Mozambique. **Note!** that input data are not fully representative and results are only indicative.

Visualized, the sample results may look like this:
