The downscaling process may be used to fill the gap in high resolution crop distribution data. Note that at the time of 
development the best available crop datasets derives from Harvest Choice and is only available at 10x10 km spatial 
resolution.

For downscaling we have decided to use the the open-source econometric model FLAT for cropland disaggregation 
(Song et al., 2018). 

The following 4 steps describe the process required to prepare the input data file for FLAT.

- Step 1. Creating crop maps per admin level
Step one assumes that raw data are only avilabla in tabular format (see for example "moz_all_data.csv" in input_data/FAO_agro_map_data).
Together with admin data (see relevant sub-folder in input_data) they are used to create raster file outputs of crop 
distribution per admin level 2. This process is implemented by "Preparing_Agro_Maps.ipynb". Sample output of this process should
look similar to "Moz_Maize_2000_admin2.shp" in Output_data\Crop_Maps.

- Step 2. Creating a grid-base-map of desired output spatial resolution
For this step we have developed a Qgis plugin which takes into account admin boundaries for the area or interest and the 
output of Step 1. The module splits the initial low granularity map to the desired output spatial resolution (e.g. 10km, 5km, 1km)
and generates an output csv file with coordinates of expected (downscaled grid cells). Installation and usage of the Qgis plugin
is available in the zip folder "Agrodem_plugin_creating_basegrid-master.zip". The output of this process should look similar to
"Moz_Maize_2000_admin2_10km.csv" in Output_data\FAO_AgroMap_Crops.

- Step 3. Collect predictor data
In this case we have decided to use 15 predictors; please see project detailed documentation for more information on their type
the the selection process. Those were collected from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and clipped/processed for the use in our modelling
exercise. This is a common statial practice and can be done in multiple ways; we have developed the "GEE_Imagery_Extraction.ipynb"
notebook as a suggested means, however each user can acquire the data as suitable per experience. Note that collected raster 
datasets cannot be provided here due to size, but are available at the project's S3 database (see link at "Raster_data.txt" in Input_data)

- Step 4. Extract predictor data to grid-base-map
In this step the grid-base map (for a certain crop) is attributed with the predictor data. The process is implemented through
"FLAT prepping.ipynb". Sample outputs are available in Output_data\FLAT_input folder.

Once the input dataset is ready (see "flat_input_Maize_10km.csv") then we can move in running the FLAT model.
