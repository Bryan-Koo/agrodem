The "Future_scenario_raster_generator" sub-folder contains the code used to generate future crop allocation rasters. This
will be updated in due time by Neeraj - VividEconomics.

Example output of this process is the "maize_BAU.tiff" located in the "Future_Scenarios\Input_data".

Processing is then undertaken by two ipynb.

Process 1. "Converting raster to vector.ipynb" converts raster (tiff) files to vector points. 

Process 2. Merges current crop extend wit future crop allocation and creates an expected crop allocation file to be used 
(after prepped) to the irrigation model.
