Creating future scenarios can be performed using the ipynbs provided here. 

Step 1. Run the "Making Future Scenarios .ipynb" which takes raw input and creates the potential extension allocation 
of a crop

Step 2. Run the "Converting raster to vector.ipynb" which turns the output raster (tiff) from step 1 to vector points for
the analysis.

Step 3. Run "Processing_Future_Scen.ipynb" which merges current crop extend with future crop allocation and creates 
an expected crop allocation file to be used (after prepped) to the irrigation model.

Step 4. Run "Changing Climatic Conditions.ipynb" in order to make other changes on the input dataset; used for minor 
sensitivity twists.

Input files for step 1 will be provided in due time as deliverable of the project.
