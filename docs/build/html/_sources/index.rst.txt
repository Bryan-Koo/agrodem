Achieving universal electricity access by 2030 will require a rapid increase in the rate of new connections and in levels of investment, particularly in countries with low level of access to electricity. The challenge is significant. Designing and selecting the optimal electrification approach requires access to reliable data and information regarding electricity resource availability, demand levels, economic activity and functional infrastructure to name a few. 

The paucity of such information may hamper electrification progress. However, this situation is gradually being improved with the increasing availability of new data and analytical tools, especially in the field of geospatial analysis. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing techniques are becoming openly available and can now provide a range of location-specific information that has not been previously accessible. Take for example the field of agriculture, where data is rapidly approaching the scale of ‘big data’. They can provide farm stakeholders with spatial and temporal information about climate and local weather, soil conditions, crop quality, field biodiversity, and crop yields. 

Inclusion of agricultural electricity demand can enhance the richness of the geospatial electrification planning process. To date, demand estimation has typically depended on measurement of population density and an assumed average residential demand. On occasion, this is augmented by including large industrial and mining load. However, existing and potential demand for electricity from agricultural is missed by this process. 

This document presents an analytical and spatially explicit approach for estimating aspects of electricity requirements related to agricultural activities. Documentation is not exhaustive and only aims to provide a clearer understanding of the main methodological steps as well as to provide direct links to open source code developed to support this exercise.
